Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women. BMI is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in meters squared.

A BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a healthy weight. A BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight. A BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese.

There are a few limitations to using BMI to measure body fat. For example, BMI does not take into account muscle mass or body composition. This means that two people with the same BMI could have very different body fat percentages.

BMI is also not a good measure of body fat for children and adolescents. This is because their bodies are still growing and developing.

Despite its limitations, BMI is a useful tool for assessing general health risk. A high BMI is associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer.
